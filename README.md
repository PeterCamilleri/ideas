# Some IDEAS

This little grouping of projects is a place to store various ideas in the
very early stages of examination. So far these are:

fractions - Some Ruby code that experiments with converting fractions to
binary fractions. This code is deliberately slowed down for dramatic effect.

io_console - Seeing just how useful require 'IO/console' is at getting low
level access to the terminal. Answer not very! :-(
