# Some IDEAS

This little grouping of projects is a place to store various ideas in the
very early stages of examination. So far these are:

args - Some experiments with portable, optional named arguments.

array_columns - An experiment in printing out an array in neat, efficient columns.

console_size - Some experiments in determining the size of the console.

continue - Rapidly concluding that the continue construct is of no value to me.

create - Studies in the creation of classes and their extend/include.

descendants - A little utility to explore the descendants of a class. I did this
because I was convinced that the PickAxe book was giving a very incomplete
picture of the Exception class tree. Seemed I was right.

excuses - a fun excuse generator.

fast_ruby - Studies in making ruby run faster.

fiber - experimenting with fibers.

formatter - experiments in aid of the format_engine gem.

fractions - Some Ruby code that experiments with converting fractions to
binary fractions. This code is deliberately slowed down for dramatic effect.

gem_usage - determine what gems use a given gem. Now broken for some reason.

getopt - some experiments with the getoptlong facility.

ginger - some encryption experiments.

io_console - Seeing just how useful require 'IO/console' is at getting low
level access to the terminal. Answer not very! :-(

manifest - what versions of modules are in the present mix.

missing - some experiments with the method_missing hook.

stdout_redirect - shell out with captured output.

subclass_string - experiments with sub classing the String class.
