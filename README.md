# Some IDEAS

**BUILD STATUS:**

![alt text](./manifest/somuchwinning.png "Volkswagen Continuous Testing")

This little grouping of projects is a place to store various ideas in the
very early stages of examination. So far these are:

args - Some experiments with portable, optional named arguments.

array_columns - An experiment in printing out an array in neat, efficient columns.

console_size - Some experiments in determining the size of the console.

continue - Rapidly concluding that the continue construct is of no value to me.

create - Studies in the creation of classes and their extend/include.

descendants - A little utility to explore the descendants of a class. I did this
because I was convinced that the PickAxe book was giving a very incomplete
picture of the Exception class tree. Seemed I was right.

excuses - A fun excuse generator.

fast_ruby - Studies in making ruby run faster.

fiber - Experimenting with fibers.

fiber/local.rb - A special study on the use of bindings and fibers to maintain
local state. Especially useful for repl applications. Tested under sever rubies.

formatter - Experiments in aid of the format_engine gem.

fractions - Some Ruby code that experiments with converting fractions to
binary fractions. This code is deliberately slowed down for dramatic effect.

gem_usage - Determine what gems use a given gem. Now broken for some reason.

getopt - Some experiments with the getoptlong facility.

ginger - Some encryption experiments.

io_console - Seeing just how useful require 'IO/console' is at getting low
level access to the terminal. Answer not very! :-(

manifest - What versions of modules are in the present mix.

math - An examination of various aspects of Ruby math.

missing - Some experiments with the method_missing hook.

rb_config - A study of the RbConfig::CONFIG hash.

questions - Code written while answering questions on stack overflow.

stdout_redirect - Shell out with captured output.

survey - A survey gem download statistics.

subclass_string - Experiments with sub classing the String class.
